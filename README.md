# SQL Basics

## What is SQL?
SQL stands for *Structured Query Language*. It is a domain-specific language used to managing data held held in relational databases. It is supported by many different databases like MySQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle.
Generally it is used to put information in database, to update it, read it and delete it. The most difficult from these four - and most complicated - is retrieving information.

## Storing a table in a database
### Table design process
When creating a table we need to answer ourselves for many questions. The most important are:
1. What kind of *thing* are we storing? **For example: we are storing the list of _cities_**
2. What properties does this *thing* have? **Each city has a _name_, _country_, _population_ and _area_**
3. What type of data does each of those properties contain? **name → _string_, country → _string_, population → _number_, area → _number_**

According to those steps we should create a **table** called *"cities"* containing **columns** called *"name", "country", "population"* and *"area"*. Each column should indicate the type of data that it is going to store.

### SQL Statement
SQL statement for creating the table mentioned in the previous section.
```
CREATE TABLE cities(
  name VARCHAR(50),
  country VARCHAR(50),
  population INTEGER,
  area INTEGER
);
```
### Inserting data into a table
When inserting the data we need to mention the table and optionally names of the columns. The order of mentioning the columns may be different to the one with which we initialized our table. Nonetheless the values for a specific record (row) need to be given in the same order as columns in a statement. We can

### SQL Statement
SQL statement for inserting data into previously created table "cities".

We can add just one row:
```
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES ('Tokyo', 'Japan', 37732000, 8231);
```
or multiple rows:
```
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population, area)
VALUES 
  ('Delhi', 'India', 32226000, 2344),
  ('Shanghai', 'China', 24073000, 4333),
  ('Sao Paulo', 'Brazil', 23086000, 3649);
```
If we won't give columns names we need to write values of a record in the same order as the table was created with.
```
INSERT INTO cities
VALUES 
  ('Mexico City', 'Mexico', 21804000, 2530);
```
If we won't write values for all of the columns, the columns for which the values weren't given will store "null".
```
INSERT INTO cities
VALUES 
  ('Cairo', 'Egypt');
```

Writing all of these statements will produce a table visualised below.
<br>CITIES:

| name | country | population | area |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tokyo | Japan | 37732000 | 8231 |
| Delhi | India | 32226000 | 2344 |
| Shanghai | China | 24073000 | 4333 |
| Sao Paulo | Brazil | 23086000 | 3649 |
| Mexico City | Mexico | 21804000 | 2530 |
| Cairo | Egypt | null | null |

## Retrieving data with SELECT
If we'd like to retrieve all of the data store in our table we can use asterisk which means "ALL" in SQL.
```
SELECT * FROM cities;
```
It will show us all of the columns with all of the records stored in the table "cities".
<br><br> We can also select just some of the columns:
```
SELECT country, name FROM cities;
```
This will show only two columns: country and name. They will be displayed in an order we write them in a statement.
<br> We can also select the same column multiple times (usefult when displaying lots of columns):
```
SELECT name, country, name FROM cities;
```
### Calculated columns
We can transform or proccess data before pulling it out from a database. We can work with different types of data.
<br><br>**NUMBERS**
<br>There are a few of math operations we can do on our record. 
<br> The basics are:

| SYMBOL | OPERATION |
| --- | --- |
| + | ADD |
| - | SUBTRACT |
| * | MULTIPLY |
| / | DIVIDE |
| ^ | EXPONENT |
| \|/ | SQUARE ROOT |
| @ | ABSOLUTE VALUE |
| % | REMAINDER |

<br>**STRINGS**
| SYMBOL | OPERATION |
| --- | --- |
| \|\| | Join two strings |
| CONCAT() | Join two strings |
| LOWER() | Gives a lowercase string |
| UPPER() | Gives an uppercase string |
| LENGTH() | Gives number of characters in a string |

<br>We can use this functions and operations in a SELECT statement to pull transformed data from our database.
<br><br> **EXAMPLES**
<br> To retrieve the density of population we need to divide population by area:
```
SELECT name, population/area AS population_density FROM cities;
```
To better understand the visualised data we can name the calculated column using alias with AS statement.
<br> To select the name and the country as a one string we can use both **||** or **CONCAT()**:
```
SELECT name || ', ' || country FROM countries;
```
or
```
SELECT CONCAT(name, ', ', country) FROM cities;
```
As we see, we can also add any string given between two single quotes.

## Filtering the data
The WHERE keyword allows us to filter the set of results we get back from a query. For example we want to see the cities which has the area over 4000 (square kilometers):
```
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE area > 4000;
```
Instead of ">" sign we can use a variety of comparison math operators:
| SYMBOL | OPERATION |
| --- | --- |
| = | Are the values equal? |
| > | Is the value on the left greater? |
| < | Is the value on the left smaller? |
| >= | Is the value on the left greater or equal to? |
| <= | Is the value on the left smaller or equal to? |
| <> or != | Are the values not equal? |
| IN | Is the value present in the list? |
| NOT IN | Is the value not present in the list? |
| BETWEEN | Is the value between two other values? |

Example for IN/NOT IN clause:
```
SELECT * FROM cities
WHERE name IN ('Tokio', 'Sao Paulo');
```
Example for BETWEEN clause:
```
SELECT * FROM cities
WHERE area BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000;
```
### Compound WHERE clauses
We can use several conditions to filter our records. To do so, we need to combine WHERE clause with AND, OR and NOT operators.
```
SELECT * FROM cities
WHERE area > 4000 AND country = 'China';
```
### Calculations in WHERE clause
It is also possible to do calculations like in SELECT clause. 
```
SELECT
  name,
  population/area AS population_density
FROM
  cities
WHERE
  population/area > 6000;
```
## Updating the rows
When we want to update the records we need to use the UPDATE and SET clauses. We always updating the ROWS. WHERE clause helps us choose the right record to update.
```
UPDATE cities
SET population = 500000000
WHERE city = 'Tokyo';
```
## Deleting the rows
Similar to updating. We use DELETE FROM clause together with WHERE to filter the right record to delete.
```
DELETE FROM cities
WHERE city = 'Tokyo';
```
## Primary and foreign keys
When designing databases usually there is a relation between them. It can be one of four:
- one-to-one
- one-to-many
- many-to-one
- many-to-many
With keys we can link two (or more) databases or tables.
### Primary key
Primary key constraint uniquely indentifies each record in the table. A table can have only one primary key and it is a column or a group of columns. It cannot contain NULL values.

### SQL Statement
Adding a primary key constraint when creating a table (for PostgreSQL):
```
CREATE TABLE newTable(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  column1 VARCHAR(200)
);
```
The data type of id "SERIAL" tells PostgreSQL to generate the values in this column for us automatically. So when adding a new record we're not going to provide any value for an id column. Then we need to mark this column as PRIMARY KEY.

### Foreign key
Foreign key constraint used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables. It is a column that references to another table. A table can have many foreign keys.

### SQL Statement
Adding a foreign key constraint when creating a table (for PostgreSQL):
```
CREATE TABLE newTable2(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  column2 VARCHAR(200),
  table_id INTEGER REFRENCES newTable(id)
);
```
We don't mark it as SERIAL because we want to specify these values. So it has a data type of INTEGER. We need to add important part of the syntax: REFERENCES and then the name of the table and the name of the column in the brackets to which this foreign key will reference.

### Foreign key constraints around insertion
When adding a new record and providing foreign key there are some restricitions:
1. When we add a foreign key that references to an existing record in the second table everything is OK.
2. When we add a foreign key that references to a record that doesn't exist it'll provide an ERROR.
3. When we don't want to add a foreign key (for some reason) to a record we need to type NULL.

### Foreing key constraints around deletion
When we want to delete a record to which another record is referenced by a foreign key, there are a few ways how to do it and what will happen. We need to add some code when creating a table to make it work. The options are:
| ON DELETE option | What happens to a record B that is referenced to beign deleted record A |
| --- | --- |
| ON DELETE RESTRICT | Throw an error |
| ON DELETE NO ACTION | Throw an error |
| ON DELETE CASCADE | Delete the record B as well |
| ON DELETE SET NULL | Set the foreign key of a record B to NULL |
| ON DELETE SET DEFAULT | Set the foreign key of a record B to a default value, if one is provided |

### SQL Statement
```
CREATE TABLE newTable2(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  column2 VARCHAR(200),
  table_id INTEGER REFRENCES newTable(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
## JOINS
JOIN clause joins two or more tables together under a specified condition. It combines rows creating a new temporary table. There are four major types of joins:
1. INNER JOIN
2. LEFT JOIN
3. RIGHT JOIN
4. FULL JOIN
<br><br>Let's assume we want to join two tables:

### INNER JOIN
It returns only the rows from all the tables being joined that fulfill the specified conditions.

### SQL Statement
```
SELECT row1, row2
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id;
```
### LEFT JOIN
It returns all of the records from the "left" table (table1) and matching records from the "right" table (table2).

### SQL Statement
```
SELECT row1, row2
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id;
```
### RIGHT JOIN
It returns all of the records from the "right" table (table2) and matching records from the "left" table (table1).

### SQL Statement
```
SELECT row1, row2
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id;
```
### FULL JOIN
It returns all of the records from both of the tables.

### SQL Statement
```
SELECT row1, row2
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id;
```
## Aggregation of records
There are two another techniques in SQL which are somehow connected to each other. It is aggregation and grouping.

### Grouping
The result of grouping is rows. We need to use GROUP BY statement. It groups rows that has the same value into the summary rows. 
### Aggregating
The result of aggregating the records is single value. The most popular are:
- COUNT() - gives the number of records
- AVG() - gives the average value
- SUM() - gives the sum
- MIN() and MAX() - gives minimum and maximum value from the group of values

Let's imagine our table with the world largest cities is full. We want to know how many cities from each country is on the list.
### SQL Statement
```
SELECT country, COUNT(name)
FROM cities
GROUP BY country;
```
The part of the result would be:
| country | count(name) |
| --- | --- |
| India | 9 |
| China | 20 |
| United States | 9 |

### Filtering groups with HAVING
To filter the obtained data with grouping we need to use HAVING clause instead of WHERE.
<br> For example, if we want to list down just the countries that have above 5 largest cities in the world it'd look like this:
```
SELECT country, COUNT(name)
FROM cities
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(name) > 5;
```
## Sorting
To sort our obtained data we need to use ORDER BY clause. In default it will order the records in an ascending way. It means from the lowest number to the highest or alphabetically. Also numbers are lower than letters - it follows ASCII table order. <br>If we want to order in a descending way we need to add DESC after the clause. 
<br>Also it is possible to order by many columns. Then you need to separate them with commas. After each column you can specify if this should be ASC or DESC.
<br><br> For example, if we want to order the group of countries by the number of cities descending and - if the numbers are the same - alphabetically it'd look like this:
```
SELECT country, COUNT(name)
FROM cities
GROUP BY country
HAVING COUNT(name) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(name) DESC, country; //we can write ASC after 'country' but it is not necessary
```
The part of the result that it is showed before would change to:
| country | count(name) |
| --- | --- |
| China | 20 |
| India | 9 |
| United States | 9 |

First it is ordered by the number of cities descending (from the highest to the lowest) and for the two countries that have the same number of cities it is additionally ordered by the country name alphabetically.

### Offset and limit
**Offset** is how many rows we want to skip and **limit** is how many rows we want to pull. By convention the limit is defined before the offset.
<br>For example we want to know what are the largest cities in the positions 8-10.
```
SELECT id, name, country
FROM cities
LIMIT 3
OFFSET 7;
```
The result would be:
| id | name | country |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | Beijing | China |
| 9 | Dhaka | Bangladesh |
| 10 | Osaka | Japan |

## Unions and intersections
Union glues together two sets of results. We need to write to separate queries and betweem them use the keyword UNION. It will join together all sets of results. It deletes all  of the duplicates. If we want to see all of the duplicate records we need to use the keyword UNION ALL. If we want to join two or more sets of results they must have the same structure. It means the same column names and the same data type in these columns.
<br> In the similar way works the INTERSECT AND EXCEPT. Intersection helps us find the common rows in all sets of results, exception returns rows that are present in the first set but not in the second one. Here works also the additional keyword ALL.
| keyword | action |
| --- | --- |
| UNION | Join together the results of two queries and remove the duplicate rows |
| UNION ALL | Join together the results of two queries |
| INTERSECT | Find the rows common in the results of two queries and remove the duplicate rows |
| INTERSECT ALL | Find the rows common in the results of two queries |
| EXCEPT | Find the rows that are present in the first query but not in the second query and remove the duplicate rows |
| EXCEPT ALL | Find the rows that are present in the first query but not in the second query |

### SQL Statement
```
(
  SELECT *
  FROM cities
  LIMIT 5
)
UNION
(
  SELECT *
  FROM cities
  LIMIT 5
  OFFSET 10
)
```
This will give us cities in the positions 1-5 and 11-15. The parethesis aren't always necessary but it's better to use them. In this case if we wouldn't use them we would end with an error because the databese wouldn't know if we want to limit and offset the partial query or the whole query.
